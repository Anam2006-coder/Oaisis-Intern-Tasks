🔹 Project Overview
I designed a modern landing page for a fictional VPN service called “SecureVPN” that includes:

A clean hero section with call-to-action buttons

Navigation bar with mobile-friendly menu

Features section highlighting core VPN benefits

Pricing plans with a “Most Popular” highlight

Download / CTA section for different platforms

FAQ and Footer for better structure and completeness

🛠 Tech Stack Used

HTML5 – for structuring the content

CSS3 – for layout, responsiveness, and styling

Basic JavaScript – for the mobile navigation toggle

📚 What I Learned

Creating a structured layout using sections, grids, and cards

Making the design responsive using media queries

Managing spacing, alignment, and color palette to keep the UI clean

Adding hover effects and small interactions to make the page more engaging

This task helped me strengthen my fundamentals in front-end development and gave me hands-on experience in building a real-world style landing page from scratch.
